\title{Generate Synthetic Multivariate Gaussian Samples with Evolving Graph Structures}
\usage{
generate_sample(sample_sizes = c(20, 40, 60, 80), rand_seed = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_sizes}{A numeric vector of length 4 (fixed) specifying the number of observations
to generate for each of the four groups. Default is \code{c(20, 40, 60, 80)}.}

\item{rand_seed}{An integer specifying the random seed for reproducibility. Default is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A list of length 4, each element being a matrix of synthetic samples (observations in rows)
generated from a multivariate normal distribution with distinct precision matrices.
}
\description{
This function generates synthetic data from 4 (fixed) multivariate Gaussian distributions with
evolving precision matrices (graph structures) of dimension 20 x 20. Starting from a base AR(2) graph, edges
are progressively added and removed to simulate structural changes across four groups.
}
\details{
The function constructs four precision matrices (A1 to A4), where A1 is a banded Toeplitz matrix
resembling an AR(2) structure. The subsequent matrices, A2, A3, and A4, are created by perturbing A1
through random edge additions and deletions. The resulting matrices are adjusted to ensure
positive definiteness, and samples are drawn using \code{rmvnorm()}
from the \pkg{mvtnorm} package.
