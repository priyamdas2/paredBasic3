Description: Provides utilities for Pareto-optimal tuning of regularized regression models such as Joint Graphical Lasso, Fused Lasso, and Elastic-Net using Gaussian Process-based optimization via the 'GPareto' package. Includes tools for visualizing trade-offs between model complexity (sparsity), coefficient magnitude, and goodness-of-fit in 3D space using 'plotly'. Useful for model selection scenarios involving competing objectives and visual exploration of optimal solutions.
